:class: information

**advancing Supercomputing, AI, and quantum technologies in Europe**

Supercomputing, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing are reshaping industries, research, and society at large. SCynergy 2025 brings together businesses, researchers, and policymakers to explore practical applications, share knowledge, and build collaborations that will shape the future of these technologies in Europe. 

Organised by Supercomputing Luxembourg, with the support of EuroHPC JU and Women in HPC, SCynergy provides a platform for experts and decision-makers to discuss how high-performance computing (HPC), AI, and quantum technologies can be applied effectively across sectors such as finance, space, healthtech,â€¯and industry.

closing jupyter lab does not stop the job on the HPC node. One needs to release the allocation
later using `scancel`.
